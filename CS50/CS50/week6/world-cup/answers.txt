Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?:

With a small number of simulations, the results vary significantly and lack consistency.
Based solely on the ratings, Brazil should win more often, but as the number of simulations increases,
Belgium has a better probability of winning.

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?:

It seems like the predictions stabilized after about 10_000 simulations. Beyond this point,
increasing the number of simulations did not significantly improve the accuracy of the predictions,
but it did lead to a substantial increase in computational time.
Therefore, considering a balance between accuracy and computational cost,
I would call the predictions "good enough" after around 1000 simulations.
