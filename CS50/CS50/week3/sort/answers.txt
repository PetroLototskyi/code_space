sort1 uses: Bubble sorting algorithm

How do you know?: It is slowest algorithm for random and reversed numbers,
but for sorted number it is speed up 20 times

sort2 uses: Merge sorting algoritm

How do you know?:It is the fastest algorithm from all three,
and his time relatively identical on sorting random, reversed and sorted numbers.

sort3 uses: Selection sorting algoritm

How do you know?: It is perform faster than first algorithm, but slower than second.
His times also relatively identical for different inputs.
