-- If songs.db contains the top 100 songs of one listener from 2018, how would you characterize their audio aura?

The audio aura extracted from songs.db would show the listener's musical atmosphere in 2018, highlighting the predominant energy,
valence, and danceability of their top 100 songs during that period.

-- Hypothesize about why the way youâ€™ve calculated this aura might not be very representative of the listener.
-- What better ways of calculating this aura would you propose?

The current calculation method, relying on a basic average, may not fully capture the listener's diverse musical
preferences and emotional nuances. To enhance representation, considering weighted averages, prioritizing frequently
played or favorite songs, would offer a more nuanced and accurate portrayal of the listener's unique audio aura.
