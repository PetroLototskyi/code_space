-- We have list of 8 ( Vanessa, Bruce, Barry, Luca, Sofia, Iman, Diana, Kelsey) suspect and their info now

--Let's check the information from the  second witness about ATM withdrawal transaction done by thief. We need to combine 3 tables

---Let check what was the the earliest next day flight. This is information from third witness

WHERE year = 2021 AND month = 7 AND day =29 ORDER BY hour LIMIT 1);
