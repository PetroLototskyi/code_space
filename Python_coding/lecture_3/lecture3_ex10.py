# Write a program to determine the length of a ladder required to reach a
# given height when leaned against a house. The height and angle of the
# ladder are given as inputs. To compute length use:
# length=heiht/sin angleÂ­
# sin angle
# Note: The angle must be in radians. Prompt for an angle in degrees and
# use this formula to convert:
# radians = p/180 degrees"
